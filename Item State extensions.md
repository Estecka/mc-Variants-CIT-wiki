# Item State Extensions

Item States (resources under the `items/` folder) are the vanilla way of changing an item's model. Those can be used to provide a second layer of variance to an item, on top of the modules from this mod.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This page is only applicable to Variants-CIT v3 (MC 1.21.4). These features are deprecated and will be removed in v4.

## Numeric Properties
Properties to be used inside the vanilla `dispatch_range` selector

### `variants-cit:stored_enchantment_level`

Returns the level of the first enchantment in `stored_enchantment`.
Behaviour is undefined on books with multiple enchantments.

> [!TIP]
>
> The `stored_enchantment` module now has built-in support for enchantment levels.

### `variants-cit:custom_data`, `entity_data`, `bucket_entity_data`, `block_entity_data`
Returns the value of the a number stored in the NBT component with matching name.

> [!TIP]
>
> The modules `axolotl_variant`, `component_data` and `component_format` now has built-in support for bucket_entity age.
>
> For other uses, `component_data` is probably still a more reliable alternative.

#### Parameters:
- `nbtPath`: *Mandatory, String.* The path to the number, with dot '`.`' separated elements.


## Model selectors
### `minecraft:range_dispatch`

The vanilla `range_dispatch` has been extended so that its entries may be automatically populated based on available models, similarly to how variant-Cit's modules work.

The selector takes a new optional field `variants-cit:baseId`, which is a namespaced identifier.
If set, the mod will look for models whose ID are the given value value followed by a number. Those models will be added to the selector's entries, using the found number as threshold.

The vanilla `entries` field is still strictly required.

## Making modded assets vanilla-compatible 

Item states that use modded properties may become completely unusable in vanilla. Variants-Cit provides a mechanism to provide a vanilla fallback to these.

Every model selector now take a new optional field `variants-cit:override`, its value is another model selector. If Variants-Cit is installed, the selector specified there will completely override its parent. In vanilla minecraft, this field will be ignored.

```json
{
	"model": {
		"//": "Uses this model in vanilla minecraft",
		"type": "model",
		"model": "...",

		"//": "Uses this model instead when variants-CIT is installed"
		"variants-cit:override": {
			"type": "range_dispatch",
			"property": "variants-cit:stored_enchantment_level",
			"//": "..."
		}
	}
}
```
