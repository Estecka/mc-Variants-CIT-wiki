# Item State Extensions

Item States (resources under the `items/` folder) are the vanilla way of changing an item's model. Those can be used to provide a second layer of variance to an item, on top of the modules from this mod.

## Model selectors
### `minecraft:range_dispatch`
> [!CAUTION]
>
> This feature is experimental. It could be removed depending what direction Mojang takes item models in the future.

The vanilla `range_dispatch` has been extended so that its entries may be automatically populated based on available models, similarly to how variant-Cit's modules work.

The selector takes a new optional field `variants-cit:baseId`, which is a namespaced identifier.
If set, the mod will look for models whose ID are the given value value followed by a number. Those models will be added to the selector's entries, using the found number as threshold.

The vanilla `entries` field is still strictly required.

## Making modded assets vanilla-compatible

Item states that use modded properties may become completely unusable in vanilla. Variants-Cit provides a mechanism to provide a vanilla fallback to these.

Every model selector now take a new optional field `variants-cit:override`, its value is another model selector. If Variants-Cit is installed, the selector specified there will completely override its parent. In vanilla minecraft, this field will be ignored.

```json
{
	"model": {
		"//": "Uses this model in vanilla minecraft",
		"type": "model",
		"model": "...",

		"//": "Uses this model instead when variants-CIT is installed"
		"variants-cit:override": {
			"type": "range_dispatch",
			"property": "variants-cit:stored_enchantment_level",
			"//": "..."
		}
	}
}
```
