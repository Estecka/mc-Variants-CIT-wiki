# Module Configuration

A module Configurations is a JSON file provided by a resource pack, located somewhere in `variants-cit/item`. It controls a large collection of CITs, and defines how to match them to an item.

## Schema
The strict minimum required to form a working module is its type, its target items, and the location of its models:

```json
{
	"type": "painting_variant",
	"items": ["painting"],
	"modelPrefix": "item/painting/",
	"modelParent": "item/generated"
}
```

(`modelParent` is technically optional, but will be useful in almost all cases.)

Here's a more complete example, as used by the mod Invariable-Paintings:

```json
{
	"type": "painting_variant",
	"items": ["minecraft:painting"],
	"priority": 0,
	"modelPrefix": "item/painting/",
	"modelParent": "minecraft:item/generated",
	"fallback": "invarpaint:item/filled_painting",
	"special": {
		"invalid": "invarpaint:item/missing_painting"
	},
	"parameters": {
	}
}
```

### `type`
**Mandatory**, Namespaced Identifier

The [type](Module-Types) of the CIT module used for this item. This affects how an item's variant is identified, and what special models are available to it.

### `items`
**Optional**, List of Namespaced Identifers, defaults to the module's id.

A list of item types the module will be applied to. The mod will silently ignore identifiers that do not match an existing item, so a texture pack will remain compatible with versions of minecraft that lacks some of the defined items.

### `priority`
**Optional**, Integer, defaults to 0.

When multiple modules are applied to the same item stack, modules with higher priorities are evaluated first. If, and only if, a module cannot provide a CIT for the item stack, then the next lower priority module will be evaluated. This can happen, if:
- The module cannot find a variant for the item.
- The module has found a variant, but that variant has no CIT, and no fallback was specified.
- The module wants to use a special model, but that model was not specified.

If your modules would almost never fail to apply a CIT, then I recommend a value around 0.
If your module often leave an item unchanged, then I recommend a value around 100.

### `modelPrefix`
**Mandatory**, String

The prefix for the CITs that this module can use. CITs can be in either of the vanilla `models/` and `textures/` folders. All assets whose path start with this string (including subdirectories) are matched to the item variant with the corresponding identifier.

The module will prioritize different types of assets depending on what is available and how other options are configured:
1. First, the module will look for a matching `model/`.
3. If absent, and if `modelParent` is also defined, then the module will look for a matching `texture/`.

Variant ID       | `<namespace>:<path>`
---------------- | :-------------------
Matching model   | `/assets/<namespace>/models/<modelPrefix><path>.json`
Matching texture | `/assets/<namespace>/textures/<modelPrefix><path>.json`


> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For compatibility with Variants-CIT v3, model prefixes should always start with `item/`

The presence or absence of a slash '`/`' at the end of a prefix is importantÂ ! It makes the difference between a prefix that consists only of directories, and a prefix that contains the beginning of a filename:
- Prefix: `enchanted_book/` -> Variant asset: `<namespace>:enchanted_book/<path>`
- Prefix: `enchanted_book_` -> Variant asset: `<namespace>:enchanted_book_<path>`


### `modelParent`
**Optional**, Namespaced Identifier.

If set, missing `models/` will be automatically generated from existing `textures/`, whose name matches the `modelPrefix`, the `fallback`, and the `special` models.

The give value is used as the generated model's parent; typically, `item/generated` for regular items, and `item/handheld` for tools. When in doubt, try using the vanilla model as parent.

Generated models:
```json
{
	"parent": "<modelParent>",
	"textures":{
		"layer0":"<namespace>:item/<modelPrefix><path>"
	}
}
```

### `fallback`
**Optional**, Namespaced Identifier.

The model to use for items for which a variant was identified, but no model was provided for this variant.
Modules with fallback are much less likely to hand over control to lower priority modules.

### `special`
**Optional**, maps Strings to Namespaced Identifiers.

A list of models that the CIT module may use in certain exceptional circumstances. What models are used and when depends on the [`type`](Module-Types) of the CIT module.

All special models are optional and default to null.
All models listed here are automatically loaded.


### `parameters`
**Type-dependent**, Object.

An object containing additional non-model parameters that affect the behaviour of the module.

The list of possible parameters and their effects depends on the [`type`](Module-Types) of the CIT module.
